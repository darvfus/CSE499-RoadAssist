✅ Libraries your project already uses

From your driverassistant.py + database sync, you need:
opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
playsound
tkinter        # comes with Python, no need to install separately
winsound       # built into Python on Windows
smtplib        # built into Python
email          # built into Python

✅ Database requirement

We are using SQLite3:

It is included with Python by default (sqlite3 module).

✅ No extra installation needed.

✅ Final requirements.txt

So your requirements.txt for detection + storage looks like this:
opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
playsound
